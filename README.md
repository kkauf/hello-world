# hello-world
This is my first project on GitHub, so I can learn to use the tool.

At my workplace, I see developers use GitHub every day to manage their work effectively and efficiently. It staggers me how suffisticated software development has become, and how so many tools are far superior to what people use in non-tech workplaces.

I hope to learn from these tools to gain a deeper understanding of how I can contribute to making organizations and people ready for a new beginning.
